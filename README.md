# NetworkX overview Jupyter Notebook and Presentation for Open University of Israel

## What is this?
This repository contains my presentation for the Open University of Israel on the topic of network data processing in Python via the NetworkX library. It goes over many basic features of NetworkX and its interoperation with Pandas.

## What's inside?
Inside you have the following important files:
- Presentation.odp - the presentation itself, in Hebrew.
- requirements.txt - requirements for the Python environment for the Notebook. I recommend using conda. You also need to add the resulting environment to Jupyter Notebook.
- version.txt - versioning file.
- vladislav_utils_v2.py - an assorted collection of functions I used to help myself make the Notebook easier to work with.
- NetworkXExamples.ipynb - the Jupyter Notebook with the NetworkX examples for the presentation.
- ./data/ - this folder contains example datasets for the Notebook.
